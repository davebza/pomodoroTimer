## Installation

Download all files, preserve folder hierarchy, and open index.html in a web browser.

## Usage example

You can select 25 minute work sessions and 5 minute break sessions. Both of these can be paused.

Each session type will also show the exact end time of the session, and appropriate messages replace the end time if the timer is paused.

An accurate date and time is also output to the browser at all times.
